# Group Photo Fusion

A free, React-based AI web app that uses Google’s Gemini generative models to merge 2–4 separate portraits into a single, realistic group photo — without anyone needing to be photographed together.

Preserves identity, clothing, lighting, and visual consistency while reconstructing a believable shared moment.
